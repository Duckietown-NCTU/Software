abstract = {  We describe a monocular robot vision system which accomplishes accurate 3-DOF dead-reckoning, closed loop motion control, and precipice and obstacle detection, all in dynamic environments, using a single, consumer-grade web cam and typical laptop computer hardware. Simultaneous translation and rotation are accurately measured, and the camera need not be placed at the robot{\&}{\#}8217;s center of rotation. The algorithm is straightforward to implement and robust to noisy measurements. The software is based on open source computer vision libraries and is itself open source. It has been tested in a wide variety of real-world environments and on several different mobile robot platforms. },

abstract = {The fusion of visual and inertial cues has become popular in robotics due to the complementary nature of the two sensing modalities. While most fusion strategies to date rely on filtering schemes, the visual robotics community has recently turned to non-linear optimization approaches for tasks such as visual Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM), following the discovery that this comes with signifi- cant advantages in quality of performance and computational complexity. Following this trend, we present a novel approach to tightly integrate visual measurements with readings from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in SLAM. An IMU error term is integrated with the landmark reprojection error in a fully probabilistic manner, resulting to a joint non-linear cost function to be optimized. Employing the powerful concept of â€˜keyframes' we partially marginalize old states to maintain a bounded-sized optimization window, ensuring real-time opera- tion. Comparing against both vision-only and loosely-coupled visual-inertial algorithms, our experiments confirm the benefits of tight fusion in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

@article{Nister2005,
abstract = {Visual odometry is the process of determining the position and orientation of a camera by analyzing a sequence of images from it. This can be useful for vehicle and robot navigation in locations where other techniques can not be used. In this master thesis a visual odometry system is implemented and evaluated. The system uses three low-cost web cameras mounted in a rig. The camera rig is calibrated i.e. the mutual position and orientation of the cameras are known. Two versions of the F{\"{o}}rstner interest operator are used to find feature points in the images. The feature points are matched between the images and there corresponding object points are triangulated. The spatial matching is simplified with help of the known epipolar ge- ometry. Four different triangulation methods are compared to see which gives the best precision of the system. The system uses a relation between the rigid body movement of the largest matchable subset of object points from two different camera positions. The optimal subset of object points is found by a ransac algorithm. The triangulation method that gives the best precision of the visual odometry system is the forward intersection method. If sub-pixel feature points is used, the precision of the system is doubled. The method of finding the optimal subset of matchable feature points is very time con- suming and has in many test been replaced by manual matching. However, with a more advanced feature point matching algorithm, the results from the the system on real world tests indicate a promising potential of the system.},

abstract = {With the advent of new, low-cost 3D sensing hardware such as the Kinect, and continued efforts in advanced point cloud processing, 3D perception gains more and more importance in robotics, as well as other fields. In this paper we present one of our most recent initiatives in the areas of point cloud perception: PCL (Point Cloud Library - http://pointclouds.org). PCL presents an advanced and extensive approach to the subject of 3D perception, and it's meant to provide support for all the common 3D building blocks that applications need. The library contains state-of-the art algorithms for: filtering, feature estimation, surface reconstruction, registration, model fitting and segmentation. PCL is supported by an international community of robotics and perception researchers. We provide a brief walkthrough of PCL including its algorithmic capabilities and implementation strategies.},

@article{Schnabel2007,
abstract = {In this work we present an automatic algorithm to detect basic shapes in unorganized point clouds. The algorithm decomposes the point cloud into a concise, hybrid structure of inherent shapes and a set of remaining points. Each detected shape serves as a proxy for a set of corresponding points. Our method is based on random sampling and detects planes, spheres, cylinders, cones and tori. For models with surfaces composed of these basic shapes only, e.g. CAD models, we automatically obtain a representation solely consisting of shape proxies. We demonstrate that the algorithm is robust even in the presence of many outliers and a high degree of noise. The proposed method scales well with respect to the size of the input point cloud and the number and size of the shapes within the data. Even point sets with several millions of samples are robustly decomposed within less than a minute. Moreover the algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Application areas include measurement of physical parameters, scan registration, surface compression, hybrid rendering, shape classification, meshing, simplification, approximation and reverse engineering},
